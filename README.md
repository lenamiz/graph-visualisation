# graph-visualisation
Graph visualisation tool

This is a tool for graph visualisation with the maximum node number of 20. Window app with simple user interface.


## Algorithm
The concept is to generate node with the biggest adjacency value first and to place it in the centre of the grid. From that point the positions of the neighbours and the remaining nodes are calculated and displayed accordingly.


## Options
Possible choices to make include:
- graph type (directed/undirected),
- edge labeling,
- edge color.

## Graph display
Graph is displayed on the grid. Each node is drawn as a circle with its value inside. Edges may be labeled and may contain an arrow at the end if directed graph is selected.
